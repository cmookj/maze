# Maze

A simple 2D maze solver based on breadth-first search.
(This program is a good example of interview problem.)

To simplify the problem, the maze is assumed to be given by a vector of the 
vector of integers, where 0 and 1 represent blocked and free region, respectively.

When this program runs, it prints the path to reach the goal given from the 
initial start position, in reverse, i.e., from the goal to the initial.
